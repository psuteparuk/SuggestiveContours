CS 348a Homework 4:  Decimation, Nonphotorealistic rendering
------------------------------------------------------------

In this homework, you will decimate meshes to a smaller number of triangles, render suggestive contours to help illustrate their shape, and implement an additional feature of your choosing.

There are several slots in need of your code, which are marked clearly and explained in the homework document.

This "skeleton code" is designed to compile on the Myth machines.  To do so, simply type "make" at the command line.  Then, to run the viewer, type:

	./drawMesh models/horse.off 
	
at the command line, where models/horse.off is the model you wish to use.

The easiest way to get started is to write your code on a Myth machine, either in person or via SSH with X forwarding.  If you prefer to work on your personal machine, you will need to modify makefile.in to point to the proper libraries.  The CAs can help you get started.
